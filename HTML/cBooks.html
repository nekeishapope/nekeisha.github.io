      <p class="book-para"> <span class="para-beging"> The C Programming Language</span>  is the top book for programmers. It is the most rate and liked book on amazon with over 1000 reviews.
          This second editon describes C as defined by the ANSI standard. This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. The book assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. A novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language.

            <span class="para-beging">C Primer Plus</span> is a carefully tested, well-crafted, and complete tutorial on a subject core to programmers and developers. This computer science classic teaches principles of programming, including structured code and top-down design.

            Author and educator Stephen Prata has created an introduction to C that is instructive, clear, and insightful. Fundamental programming concepts are explained along with details of the C language. Many short, practical examples illustrate just one or two concepts at a time, encouraging readers to master new topics by immediately putting them to use.
            
            Review questions and programming exercises at the end of each chapter bring out the most critical pieces of information and help readers understand and digest the most difficult concepts. A friendly and easy-to-use self-study guide, this book is appropriate for serious students of programming, as well as developers proficient in other languages with a desire to better understand the fundamentals of this core language.

        <p class="book-para">
            <span class="para-beging">C How to Program</span> is a comprehensive introduction to programming in C. Like other texts of the Deitels’ How to Program series, the book serves as a detailed beginner source of information for college students looking to embark on a career in coding, or instructors and software-development professionals seeking to learn how to program with C.

            The Eighth Edition continues the tradition of the signature Deitel “Live Code” approach--presenting concepts in the context of full-working programs rather than incomplete snips of code. This gives students a chance to run each program as they study it and see how their learning applies to real world programming scenarios.

            This book/CD package is called<span class="para-beging"> "The Hard Way,"</span> but it's really quite easy: it just requires discipline, practice, and persistence. Shaw teaches how to write modern, clean, clear C code through dozens of brilliantly-crafted exercises, most on two pages. You simply read each exercise, type in its sample code precisely (no copy-and-paste!), and make the programs run. As you read, type, fix your mistakes, and watch the results, you learn how C works… what good modern C programs look like… how to read, write, and "see" code… how to spot crucial differences that change or break programs… all the essentials of C logic, I/O, variables, and functions… and the attention to detail that is indispensable to successful C programming. At first, yes, it can be difficult. But it gets easier.
